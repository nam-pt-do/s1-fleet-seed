            <p>6.3  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensor grants Licensee a "right to use" license to any Software or Third Party Software Derivative Works for internal business purposes only under the same terms and conditions that apply to Software, Documentation, or Third Party Software under Article 2 herein.</p>

If, during the Warranty Period, an Error occurs (where "Error" is defined as a problem caused by an incorrect operation of the unmodified computer code in Software or an incorrect statement or diagram in Documentation that produces incorrect results), Licensor will use commercially reasonable efforts to correct such Error, provided you furnish Licensor with the following: (a) written notice of the warranty claim, including a description of the failure to perform in accordance with Documentation and a specific description of the operating conditions (including the specific software/hardware configuration) under which the failure occurred, and (b) to the extent feasible, a representative sample of inputs for repeating and analysing the failure. If Licensor is unable, after commercially reasonable efforts, to correct the Error, your sole remedy shall be termination of this License and a refund of the license fees allocable to the specific nonconforming Software that have been paid by you to Licensor hereunder.</p>
            <p>7.3  Article 7 provides the exclusive remedies for all claims based on failure of or defect in Software and Documentation, whether the failure or defect arises before, during, or after the applicable Warranty Period and whether a claim, however described, is based on contract, warranty, indemnity, tort/extracontractual liability (including negligence), strict liability, or otherwise. The warranties provided in Article 7 are exclusive and are in lieu of all other warranties, conditions and guarantees whether written, oral, implied, or statutory. NO IMPLIED STATUTORY WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE APPLIES.

Proprietary Information includes commercially valuable, substantial trade secrets, the design and development of which reflect the effort of skilled development experts and investment of considerable amounts of time and money.</p>
            <p>8.2 You acknowledge: (a) any use of Software, Documentation, or Third-Party Software in a manner inconsistent with this License or (b) any other misuse of Proprietary Information of Licensor (or its suppliers), will cause immediate irreparable harm to Licensor (or its suppliers) for which there is no adequate remedy at law. You agree that Licensor (or its suppliers) shall be entitled to immediate and permanent injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in the event of any such misuse or threatened misuse by you.  The parties agree and stipulate that Licensor shall be entitled to such injunctive relief without posting of a bond or other security; provided, however, that if the posting of a bond is a prerequisite to obtaining injunctive relief, then a bond in an amount equivalent to U.S. $1,000 shall be sufficient. Nothing contained herein shall limit Licensor's right to any remedies at law, including the recovery of damages from you for breach of this License.</p>
            <p><b>9.            Compliance With Laws.</b> You understand and recognize that Software, Documentation, and Third-Party Software made available to you hereunder are subject to all U. S. and other applicable trade control laws and regulations.

            <p>10.2                Seller shall not be liable for loss of profit or revenues, loss of product, loss of use of Software, Documentation, or Third-Party Software or any associated equipment, interruption of business, cost of capital, cost of cover or replacement, downtime costs, increased operating costs claims of your customers for such damages, or for any special, consequential, incidental, indirect, punitive or exemplary damages.</p>

            <p><b>11.          Dispute Resolution, Governing Law.</b> 11.1 If you have your pertinent place of business in a country other than the U.S., any dispute arising out of or in connection with this License, including any question regarding its existence, validity or termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration under the London Court of International Arbitration ("LCIA") Rules, which Rules are incorporated by reference into this Article 11.1.

            <p>11.2                If you have your pertinent place of business in the U.S. any claim, legal action or proceeding (including without limitation claims for set-off or counterclaim) regarding the dispute arising out of or in connection with this License, shall be brought in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, or in the event that court lacks jurisdiction to hear the claim, in the appropriate state courts of Cobb County, Georgia, and the parties irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in respect of all such claims. Each party hereby submits to and accepts generally and unconditionally the jurisdiction of those courts with respect to its respective person and property, and irrevocably consents to the service  of process in connection with any such action or proceeding by personal delivery to the party or by the mailing thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid to the other party at the address for the party.</p>
            <p>11.3                Notwithstanding the terms above, each party has the right at any time, at its option and where legally available, to commence an action or proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction to apply for interim or conservatory measures, but not monetary damages.</p>
            <p>11.4                The validity, performance and all matters relating to the interpretation and effect of this License and all further documents executed pursuant to it shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of (i) the State of New York, U.S., if you have your pertinent place of business in the U.S. or (ii) England and Wales if you have your pertinent place of business outside of the U.S., excluding its rules on the conflict or choice of laws.

            <p><b>12.          Intellectual Property Indemnification.</b> 12.1 Licensor shall indemnify you against any damages, costs and expenses arising out of any suit, claim, or proceeding (a "Claim") alleging that Software or Documentation infringes a patent in effect in the U.S., an EU member state or country of delivery (provided there is a corresponding patent issued by the U.S. or an EU member state), or U.S. copyright or copyright registered in the country of delivery; provided that: (a) you promptly notify Licensor in writing of any such Claim; (b) you make no admission of liability and gives Licensor sole authority, at Licensor's expense, to direct and control all defense, settlement, and compromise negotiations; and (c) you provide Licensor with full disclosure and assistance that may be reasonably required to defend any such Claim.</p>
            <p>12.2                Licensor shall have no obligation or liability with respect to any Claim based upon: (a) any Software or Documentation that has been altered, modified, or revised; (b) the combination, operation, or use of any Software or Documentation with other products or services when such combination is part of any allegedly infringing subject matter; (c) failure of you to implement any update provided by Licensor that would have prevented the Claim; or (d) unauthorized use of Software or Documentation, including, without limitation, a breach  of the provisions of this License.</p>
            <p>12.3                Should any Software or Documentation, or any portion thereof, become the subject of a Claim, Licensor may at its option (a) procure for you the right to continue using Software or Documentation, or portion thereof, (b) modify or replace it in whole or in part to make it non-infringing, or (c) failing (a) or (b), take back Software or Documentation and refund any fees received by Licensor attributable to the infringing Software or Documentation.</p>
            <p>12.4                This states Licensor's entire liability for indemnification for intellectual property rights infringement for Software or Documentation. You waive any moral rights.</p>
            <p>12.5                Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Third-Party Software, or portions thereof, only the indemnity of the manufacturer/developer, if any, shall apply.</p>
            <p><b>13.          General Clauses.</b> 13.1 Software and Third-Party Software licensed hereunder are not intended for use in connection with any nuclear facility or activity without the written consent of Licensor. You warrant that you shall not use, or permit others to use Software or Third-Party Software for such purposes, unless Licensor agrees to such use in writing. If, in breach  of the foregoing, any such use occurs, Licensor disclaims all liability for any nuclear or other damages, injury or contamination and in addition to any other legal or equitable rights of Licensor, you shall indemnify and hold Licensor harmless against any such liability. If Licensor agrees in writing to any such nuclear use, Licensor's special terms and conditions for nuclear applications and protections against nuclear liability shall be attached and incorporated fully herein by reference.</p>
            <p>13.2                Licensor may assign or novate its rights and obligations under this License, in part or in whole, to any of its affiliates or may assign any of its account receivables under this License to any third party without your consent. You agree to execute such documents as may be necessary to effect the assignment or novation. The delegation or assignment by you of any or all of your duties or rights under this License without Licensor's prior written consent shall be void.</p>
            <p>13.3                If any provision of this License is found to be void or unenforceable the remainder of this License shall not be affected and the parties hereby agree that they will replace any such void or unenforceable provision with a new provision that achieves substantially the same practical or economic effect and which is valid and enforceable.</p>
            <p>13.4                This License represents the entire agreement between the parties, and no modification, amendment or waiver shall be binding on either party unless agreed in writing by the parties' authorized representatives.</p>
            <p>13.5                For direct and indirect U.S. government contracts and/or contracts funded in whole or in part by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) only, all Software, Documentation and Third-Party Software provided hereunder shall be considered "commercial items" as defined in FAR Part 2, 2.101 and in accordance with FAR 52.244-6. To the full extent permitted under FAR Part 12, the terms and conditions of FAR 52.212-4 are replaced by the Terms and Conditions set forth in this License. Therefore, no governmental contracting provisions, standards or requirements, including without limitation those relating to cost accounting and the Truth-in-Negotiations Act, shall apply except those expressly accepted in writing by Licensor. If the reasonableness of the price cannot be established, if cost or pricing data is required for any other reason, or if the Software, Documentation or Third-Party Software cannot be considered "commercial items," or if the License is funded in whole or part by ARRA funds and Licensee does not so notify Licensor in writing prior to Licensor agreeing to the transaction, Licensor may withdraw the proposal or cancel this License without penalty or other liability and be reimbursed for work performed to date.</p>
            <p>13.6                Upon request you agree to provide Licensor with a signed copy of this License.</p>
