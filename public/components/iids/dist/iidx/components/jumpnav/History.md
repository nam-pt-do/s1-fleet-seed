0.6.4 / 2014-1-8
==================
* Fix for thrashing when content is just tall enough to allow the nav to go to position, but when it does it removes enough height to bring it back to normal

0.6.2 / 2013-11-21
==================
* Use different BG color for IIDX when in scrolling

0.6.1 / 2013-11-19
==================
* Allow themeing to support the different design systems
* Allow top margin that will be cancelled out when navbar is active
* Note that at this point IIDX is at 1.1 for GE-Bootsrap, despite the dependency on 1.2 - the ref is forced by the design system itself

0.5.1 / 2013-11-05
==================
* Navbar updates to reflect design feedback and branding changes
* Bower update

0.2.0 / 2013-07-07
==================
* Migrate off require-jquery
* Migrate to Bootstrap 2.3.2
