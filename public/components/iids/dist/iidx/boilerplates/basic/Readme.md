IIDS Boilerplate: Basic Application
===================================

## Quick Start

- Copy this folder to your working directory
- Move the IIDS folder and files into the root of your project's working directory
- Update the paths to your asset files in `index.html`
- We have created starter `js` and `less` folders to kickstart your project

## What's Provided

The template `index.html` utilizes fthe following JavaScript files:

- [jquery](http://jquery.com/)
- [modernizr](http://modernizr.com/)
- [requireJS](http://requirejs.org/)
- [respondJS](https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond)

The index also links to the IIDS stylesheets.

## RequireJS

The IIDS uses [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) to load JavaScript modules asynchronously.
A solid understanding of RequireJS is essential if you want to work with the IIDS.
Please take a moment to [read through the RequireJS documentation](http://requirejs.org/)
and familiarize yourself with the technology.
